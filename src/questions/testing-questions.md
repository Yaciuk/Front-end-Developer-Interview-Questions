* What is the purpose of a code style linting tool?

Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. This is done by using a lint tool (otherwise known as linter). A lint tool is a basic static code analyzer.

Lint programming is a type of automated check. It should happen early in development, before code reviews and testing. Thatâ€™s because automated code checks make the code review and test processes more efficient. And they free your developers to focus on the right things.

* What are some of the testing best practices?

1. Rely Only on a Controlled Security Environment for Testing
2. Carry Tests Throughout the Software Development Cycle
3. Break Tests in Small Fractions
4. Write Tests for Maximum Coverage
5. Carry Regression Tests
6. Programmers Should Not Write Tests
7. Note and Report All Tests
8. Clean the Test Code Prior to Final Release of Software Product
9. Isolate the Application from Developers
10. Customize Testing
11. Accumulated Skilled Testers
12. Build a Target Operating Model for Testing
